# DevOps 101 | The Third Way: The Technical Practices of Continual Learning and Experimentation

This is the part 4 of 4 of this DevOps 101 series.

The third way defines the **technical practices of continual learning
and experimentations**. Learning from successes and failures is crucial
to improve the quality of work. Furthermore, when the flow and the
feedback loop are short and strong, it is easier and safer to
experiment and take calculated risks. Ultimately, fast learning
and experimentations help to outdo the competition and win in the
marketplace.

## Enable and Inject Learning into Daily Work

### Establish a just, learning culture
*What*

Having accidents in a software system is almost inevitable. To keep a
high level of quality, we must establish a just, learning culture.
Being just means that we recognized that when human error occurs, it
isn't caused by a bad human, but rather by design problems in the
complex system that we created. We must also treat every accident as an
opportunity to learn why it occurred, and how we can prevent similarly
issues in the future

*Why*

When accidents are viewed with a perspective of learning, it makes
people feel safe. This means that people are not afraid to share
details on mistakes that they made, and also are enthusiastic in
helping the rest of the company avoid the same error in the future.
Consequently, it allows knowledge to be shared around, which elevates
everyone to become better.


### Schedule blameless post-mortem meetings after accidents occur
*What*

A post-mortem meeting is a meeting to focus and learn on the causes of
a given accident, and on the decision-making processes of the people
that worked on that accident. People in a post-mortem meeting should do
the following:

- Construct a timeline and gather details on failures
- Empower all engineers to improve safety by allowing them to give
detailed accounts of their contributions to failures
- Enable and encourage people who do make mistakes to educate others on
how not to make them in the future
- Accept that there is always a discretionary space where humans can
decide to take action or not, and that the judgment of those decisions
lies in hindsight
- Propose countermeasures to prevent similar accidents and ensure that
they are followed up.

*Why*

The main benefit of scheduling post-mortem meetings is that it allows
to understand why an accident happened and to work on and record a
solution that would prevent such accidents from happening in the
future. Another important aspect of post-mortems is to reinforce a
blameless culture where accidents are an opportunity to learn. Over
time, this makes the individuals better at preventing accidents and
increases organizational sharing and learning.

## Convert Local Discoveries into Global Improvements

### Automate standardized processes in software for re-use
*What*

When a new software entity (infrastructure, process, etc) is created,
sometimes the hows and whys related to that process are hard to find,
or simply lost. To ensure that relevant information stays around, we
need to transform these documented standards and process into an
executable form that makes them easier to reuse. For example, we could
store all the tools and processes in a central repository, or even make
an executable program that wraps everything neatly in a central tool
that could be used by everyone.

*Why*

We make sure that well designed tools and processed are widely
available and adopted by everyone. It means that people don't have to
reinvent the wheel every time when trying to design something, which
saves some time. It also means that the errors (hopefully) won't get
repeated.


## Reserve Time to Create Organizational Learning and Improvement

### Institutionalize rituals to pay down technical debt
*What*

Technical debt can be caused by many factors like compensating for a
lack of time caused by a scheduled release, or because the system is
growing in an unexpected way. Independent of the cause, it is
important to keep technical debt to a minimum. One way of doing so is
to schedule recurring improvement blitzes, where teams self-organize
and fix problems that are impeding them in doing their work. It could
be a problematic area of the code, environment, architecture, tooling,
etc.

*Why*

Creating improvement blitzes has many benefits. The most obvious one
is that every part of the system could get improved. It's the perfect
moment to focus on non-functional aspects (like performance, stability
or security) as well, which is really beneficial for the overall
health of the business. Furthermore, it empowers people to identify
and fix problems they encounter everyday, which promotes a culture of
high quality and continual improvements.

### Enable everyone to teach and learn
*What*

The simplest way to encourage learning and teaching is to dedicate
organizational time to it. Learning could be done by taking classes,
reading books, or attending a conference and/or workshops. Teaching is
also an important part of the equation and can be done via mentoring,
writing blog posts, or making conference presentations for example.

*Why*

Teaching and learning from others in an organization obviously spread
the knowledge from and to everyone, which helps the organization to
get better on many aspects (software quality, efficiency, morale, etc).
