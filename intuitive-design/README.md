# Intuitive Design - Eight Steps to an Intuitive UI

This post talks about intuitive UI design. More specifically, it defines the term "intuitive design", describes the attributes of an intuitive design and propose a design process for intuitive designs.

## Motivations

As full stack web developers, we spend a fair amount of time working on the frontend part of the software we develop. Most of the time, we have designers that provide us with UI mocks. This is good for many cases.

However, I think that developers should have a strong, objective knowledge on what makes a good UI design.
I think it could make us more effective when participating in UI work/ideation sessions. Also, it could allows us to be less dependent on designers when we have to implement small and simple UI elements.

I search some reference books regarding UI/UX design and I found the following book.

The author, Everett McKay, is a software developer that spent a great amount of his career working on user interface design. The book is pragmatic and expose a solid, objective foundation for intuive UI design.

This post summarizes the ideas from the book.

## Intuitive Design - Definition


What I like the most about the book is that the author gives a good pratical about intuitive UI.

> A user interface is intuitive when target users understand its behavior and effect without use of reason, memorization, experimentation, assistance, or training.

I think the word 'intuitive' here doesn't really matter. It could have been substituted by any other similar words and it would have the same effect.

Intuitive UI are important, because they allow the user to use successfully an application without any prior knowledge or training. This quality attribute is essential nowadays, since the software application competition is really high.

## Eight Attributes of Intuitive Design

The previous definition tells us what should be the effects of an intuitive UI. However, it doesn't tell us what makes a UI intuitive. To find that, let's have a goal-driven approach by using the interaction life, i.e. the steps that the users need to do to complete their goal.

The author defines the interaction lifecyle.

> To interact with your product, the user
> 1. Sets a goal to accomplish
> 1. Finds the starting point that might achieve the goal
> 1. Performs the action
> 1. Observes the action's results to determine whether the goal was achieved as expected
> 1. If successful, continues to the next goal; otherwise, fixes any problems and tries

Many problems can happens during this interaction (don't know where to start, wrong starting point, wrong action performed, etc).

The following attributes help mitigate the potential problems in the interaction lifecycle, so the user can perform their goal without use of reason, memorization, experimentation (hence satistying the definition of intuitive).

### Discoverability

To start the interaction lifecyle, the user must know where to start.

> *Discoverability* is the target users' ability to locate the UI elements needed to acheive a goal - when they need them.

The simplest way to provide Discoverability is to have an obvious starting point.

Google home page is a good example. The vast majority of user that visits the google.com page have a search-related goal.

The element used to search (here, the search) is easily discoverable, because there are very few elements on that page. Furthermore, the search bar element is one of the most prominent element on the page, even when it's competing with other elements (the interactive game doodle in the previous example).

#### Quick Tips

* Put main elements in a good location
* Have a good layout
* Have a very few competing options

### Affordance

When the user discovered the element that they need to use, they must figure how to interact with it. That where affordance comes in.

> Affordances are the visual properties of a UI element that suggest how to perform an interaction.

Button show one of the most basic example of affordance. Let's look at various Material Design button varieties.

From the four varieties of buttons, the "Raised Buttons" have the best affordance. The fact that it shows shadows as the button was elevated (hence the name "Raised") mimics real life button. Thus, it really suggests the user to push the button, which means that a raised button provide affordance by definition.

The "Basic Button" have the least affordance in the previous example. It doesn't look like a button at first glance. The user have to hover the button to discover that it is a button, but that is not a good experience on mobile since there are no hover.

However, having basic buttons can help to have an intuitive design. It would most likely be used as a secondary action. Furthermore, the context and location of those buttons can provide affordance (for example, a cancel action).


#### Quick Tips

* Use UI convention to show affordance for standard UI elements
* Provide a clear affordance for primary interactions
* Secondary interactions can show a little less affordance, as this could confuse the user
