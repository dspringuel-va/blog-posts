# Intuitive Design - Eight Steps to an Intuitive UI

This post talks about intuitive UI design. More specifically, it defines the term "intuitive design", describes the attributes of an intuitive design and propose a design process for intuitive designs

## Motivations

As full stack web developers, we spend a fair amount of time working on the frontend part of the software we develop. Most of the time, we have designers that provide us with UI mocks. This is good for many cases.
However, I think that developers should have a strong, objective knowledge on what makes a good UI design.

I think it could make us more effective when participating in UI work/ideation sessions. Also, this allows us to be less dependent on designers when we have to implement small and simple UI elements.

I search some reference books regarding UI/UX design and I found the following book.

The author, Everett McKay, is a software developer that spent a great amount of his career working on user interface design. The book is pragmatic and expose a solid, objective foundation for intuive UI design.

This post summarizes the ideas from the book.
